# Schematron
The Schematron files in this repository are to support GEMINI 2.3 validation.

They were prepared in 2018 by BGS under contract to AGI, funded by Defra, and are released under CC-BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), as is the rest of GEMINI.

They are also available (as a zip file) at https://www.agi.org.uk/about/resources/category/125-schematron

The home of GEMINI is https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/

Note: Defra sponsored creation of Schematron files to support validation of the older GEMINI 2.2, which are still available via https://guidance.data.gov.uk/publish_and_manage_data/harvest_or_add_data/harvest_data/gemini/#iso-19139.
